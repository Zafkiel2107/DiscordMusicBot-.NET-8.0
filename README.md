I made this bot for my friends in discord, but you can use it too or write your own bot based on mine, it's pretty simple!

Commands:

@Bot join - joining a bot to your channel
@Bot leave - disconnecting the bot from your channel
@Bot play "somevalue" - searches for a track on the YouTube platform, downloads and launches it (or puts it in a queue)
@Bot pause - stops the track
@Bot resume - resumes the track
@Bot stop - stops the player from working
@Bot skip - skips the current track

You need to install the latest [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) package and [Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases) in your project in advance. You will also need to create a [file](https://github.com/Zafkiel2107/DiscordMusicBot-.NET-8.0/blob/master/application.yml) named _application.yml_ with the following contents. At the end, create a bot in discord, get its token and give it the appropriate rights to play music.
